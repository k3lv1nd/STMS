# STMS-SYSTEM
A simple time management system
The goals of this simple project are:
User must be able to create an account and log in
User can add (and edit and delete) a row what he has worked on, what date, for how long
User can add a setting (Preferred working hours per day)
If on a certain date a user has worked under the PreferredWorkingHourPerDay, these rows are red, otherwise green.
Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
Filter entries by date from-to
Export the filtered times to a sheet in HTML
